Scala program which satisfies the following traits:

1.  Using a mathematical method of your choice, implement the square root function by employing as many functional programming principles as possible in Scala.

2.  Once the program is complete, provide accompanying documentation with relevant detail which provides instructions on how to compile and execute the program for a layperson.

    a.  Assume the layperson is capable of all basic tasks related to using a computer such as basic navigation, running programs, troubleshooting basic issues etc.

    b.  Assume that the machine has the following attributes:

        i.    Windows 10

        ii.   IntelliJ IDEA installed

        iii.  Scala installed
 

Feel free to submit the problem in any way you feel is appropriate i.e. inclusion of unit tests, packaged as a JAR file, committed to your personal Git repo etc.

As a high-level rubric, I will assess your program for its completeness, execution, style, and adherence to good coding practices.

addendum:

1.  No preference on the input method although it is sufficient if you can design the function for a single input.

2.  For the sake of simplicity, the function should be able to handle only reals.
